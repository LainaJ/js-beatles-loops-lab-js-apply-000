// add solution here//
//1) Beatles Loops returns an array of strings containing what instruments each musician plays


function theBeatlesPlay (musicians, instruments){
  for (var i = 0; i < musicians.length; i++)
  return i;
  }

  //var musicians = []
  //var instruments = []
  //musicians.push("John Lennon", "Paul McCartney", "George Harrison", "Ringo Starr")
  //instruments.push("Guitar", "Bass Guitar", "Lead Guitar", "Drums")
